## 🔹 Workflow 
1. **Excel (Importing)** 
    - Patient health records imported from CSV/Excel files. 
    - Initial exploration of raw data.
2. **Power Query (Cleaning)**
      - Removed duplicates and null values.
      - Standardized categories (e.g., BP levels, stress levels, cholesterol status). 
      - Derived **3 analytical datasets** from the master dataset for focused analysis.
3. **Power BI (Measures & Visualization)**
    - Created DAX measures (e.g., On-Time Delivery %, Heart Disorder Rate).
    - Built dashboards with charts for:
       - Heart disorder by gender
       - BP category distribution
       - Stress level impact
       - Lifestyle factors (exercise, smoking, alcohol)
    - Published interactive reports for decision-making.
